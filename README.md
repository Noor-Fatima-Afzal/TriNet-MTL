# TriNet-MTL: A Multi-Branch Deep Learning Framework for Biometric Identification and Cognitive State Inference from Auditory-Evoked EEG

This repo contains code for training and evaluating a multi-task Transformer-based classifier for EEG signals to perform simultaneous classification of:
- Biometric identity (20 subjects)
- Language condition (native vs non-native)
- Device modality (in-ear vs bone-conduction)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
